# Security policy
**Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, you can report them using [our security page](https://github.com/OpenLEADR/openleadr-rs/security).
Alternatively, you can also send them by email to security@openleadr.org.

Include as much of the following information as you can:

* Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, privilege escalation, etc.).
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL).
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue.
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue.
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue.

## Preferred Languages
We prefer to receive reports in English. If necessary, we also understand German and Dutch.

## Disclosure Policy
We adhere to the principle of [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://vuls.cert.org/confluence/display/CVD/Executive+Summary).

# Security Advisories
Security advisories will be published [on GitHub](https://github.com/OpenLEADR/openleadr-rs/security/advisories) and possibly through other channels.
